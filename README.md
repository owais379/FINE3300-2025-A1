Assignment #1

This Python project calculates Canadian mortgage payments and currency exchange rates. It features a mortgage calculator that computes various payment frequencies (monthly, bi-weekly, weekly, etc.) for fixed-rate Canadian mortgages. The project also includes a currency converter that reads live exchange rate data from a CSV file to convert between USD and CAD. Built using OOP (Object Oriented Programming). Users can input their mortgage details or currency amounts through straightforward prompts in the terminal when the scripts are run. This is the first assignment in my class: FINE3300 (Python for Finance Professionals). The code is relatively easy to understand and extend for future use.
